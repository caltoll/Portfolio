Portfolio
=========

A collection of completed projects. Still very much in the process of being updated.

TicTac
------

Work in progress TicTacToe (noughts and crosses) game for two people.
Working on adding AI but taking a while

HalfLife
--------

ActivityCalc.cpp is a short program which takes command line arguments of the year a particular sample was bought, its radioactivity at the time,and the isotope in question, returning its current activity. Adding to isotopelist.txt will add futher isotopes to it.u 

In the laboratory where I was working radioactive samples were used to calibrate equipment. However, labs being labs, some samples with a short half-life had almost decayed away. It is time consuming to look up the half-lives of every isotope and calculate the relevant details, so I made a short program to do it for you.
